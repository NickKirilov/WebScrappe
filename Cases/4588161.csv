4588161,Options for Supported Living,"Prosecution of Options for Supported Living Ltd, a care agency supporting people with mental health issues, its manager and a care home, after one of it's employee's was stabbed by a resident. The employee of Options for Supported Living was undertaking a regular scheduled visit to assist the transition of services for a resident from Fulwood Care Ltd to Options for Supported Living.  During the visit the untrained Options employee was left alone in the kitchen with the individual despite the care plan stating that the resident required the attendance of two care workers at all times. Whilst the employee was unaccompanied, the resident stabbed the employee in the right side of their neck.
An investigation by HSE found that despite the City Council, the NHS Mental Health Trust and Fulwood Care Limited care plans  and risk assessments being in place, all of which indicated  the high risk the individual posed to themselves and others, neither Options, including the manager Marie Binns nor Fulwood Care Limited took account of these documents prior to the visits by the Options employee. It was also found that dedicated training and a full risk assessment and care plan for that individual were not undertaken by Options for Supported Living in order to identify the triggers for violence and aggression, and how the risk could be managed.  The need for 2.1 supervision, triggers (things not to say or do) should have been identified and copies of the documents given to Options employees prior to their visits.  Arrangements with regard to communication and supervision by the two care agencies should also have been undertaken and adequate supervision during visits provided by both Options,  and Fulwood Care.",30/09/2014,"£31,000.00","£10,000.00",37 Ampthill RoadLiverpoolMerseysideL17 9QNEngland,North West,Liverpool,Total service industries,88100 - SOCIAL WORK ACTIVITIES W/O ACCOMMODATION FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED,,FODOP2GP8,Field Operations Division,,North West,2022-05-17 12:41:49.101153+00:00
