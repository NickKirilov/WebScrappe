4649995,AMC Freshly Squeezed (UK) Limited,"Prosecution of AMC Freshly Squeezed (UK) Limited after an employee had three fingers of their right hand severed whilst cleaning a screw conveyor. Whilst carrying out the daily process of cleaning the extraction area the production operative noticed that no water or debris was exiting the drain as it normally would. In an attempt to remove the blockage, the worker inserted their hand through the drain hole resulting in the injury. The investigation by HSE found that although removal of the drain plug was done daily the company failed to identify and therefore eliminate the dangers involved in accessing the moving parts of the open drain point of the screw conveyor. No risk assessments were undertaken and no safe systems of work were in place. The company did not provide staff with adequate training or make them aware of the dangers associated with the machinery being used.",22/07/2019,"£16,000.00","£2,400.00",AMC Freshly Squeezed (UK) LimiDegrave HouseWhitemoss Business ParkSKELMERSDALELancashireWN8 9TQEngland,North West,West Lancashire,Manufacturing,10320 - MF FRUIT/VEGETABLE JUICE,Fixed,FODOP2GP8,Field Operations Division,,North West,2022-05-16 15:06:26.165502+00:00
