Between 1/10/2018 and the 25/11/2018 Paul Chappells carried out gas work at two domestic properties in Hyde and Poynton but did not hold the necessary registration to complete this work.

The work on the boiler was later found to be of a poor standard and was identified as “at risk” by a Gas Safe Inspector.
