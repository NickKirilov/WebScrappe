4486403,Apache Beryl I Limited,"Production operations personnel on the installation commenced a work task involving the depressurisation (venting) of a platform well annulus to the separation system on gas lift well number A86.  The production technician allocated to, and in the execution of, this task proceeded to configure, and lock open, certain wellhead valves, including the Production Wing Valve, which meant that ESD (Emergency Shutdown Down) functionality was no longer available on demand should an emergency shutdown of the plant be required.  Shortly after the task had commenced a hydrocarbon release (HCR) occurred when a section of smallbore tubing located downstream failed. The GPA (General Platform Alarm) sounded and the deluge activated in the area. Normally during an incident of this nature the process systems blow down through the flare in approximately 15-20 minutes.  However, as the production wing valve was locked open it could not close on ESD activation. The Offshore Installation Manager considered abandonment of the platform as he thought that the gas release may have developed into an uncontrollable release, as the plant was not blowing down on demand as expected, and the information that he had received from production personnel involved in the task led him to believe that both the A86 well annulus and tubing were live to the flow line and the wellhead valves were not forming a well barrier.  However, gas levels did recede gradually and the OIM stood down the platform muster after over 6 ½ hours. 

The size of the gas release associated with this incident has been estimated  as 1035 kg. Apache's key failure is that of failing to provide a safe system of work or procedure for venting gas lift wells.",02/06/2014,"£400,000.00",£0.00,"Beryl A/Apache BerylLine 1, QTY, NQAGBR",,Not Applicable,Extractive and utility supply industries,06100 - EXTRACTION OF CRUDE PETROLEUM,Offshore Safety Directive Regulator,EDHOU7S,Energy Division,,,2022-05-17 12:41:18.141559+00:00
