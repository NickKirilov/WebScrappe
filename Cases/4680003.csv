4680003,Umar Akram Khatab,"Prosecution of Umar Akram Khatab after multiple health and safety issues were found at a construction site in South Street, Manchester when HSE Inspectors carried out a proactive COVID-19 Spot Check.  During the inspection it was found that there were inadequate safety measures provided for working at height, insufficient welfare standards, no COVID-19 measures, no site security, impeded ingress and egress and no safety measures practiced when working with electricity. A Prohibition Notice regarding working at height and several Improvement Notices were served on that day.
A return inspection was made after very little communication from the principal contractor. No improvements had been made regarding the issues, and, in addition to these an unsupported excavation was discovered. New Improvement Notices were served during this visit, with still no communication from the principal contractor. It was subsequently established that none of the three Improvement Notices had been complied with.",09/07/2020,£0.00,"£3,000.00",South StreetManchesterGreater ManchesterEngland,North West,Manchester,Construction,41202 - CONSTRUCTION DOMESTIC BLDGS,,CDOP2GP8,Construction Division,,North West,1652956737.4969804
