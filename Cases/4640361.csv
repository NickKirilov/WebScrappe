4640361,Christopher Ellor,"Prosecution of Christopher Ellor director of Dealercast Limited after an employee’s hand was drawn into a roller, resulting in the amputation of a finger. The employee was being trained by company director Chris Ellor to use a rolling machine to bend pieces of steel tube.  Whilst feeding the tubing between the rollers of the machine, the heavy-duty gloves he was wearing caught between the tubing and one of the rollers, drawing his hand into the machine. An investigation HSE found that a machine specific risk assessment had not been performed by the company, and so the risk of entanglement in moving parts had not been highlighted. The employee had no previous experience of working on this type of machine and had not completed training.  The use of gloves when working with machinery was standard practice and the company had failed to recognise and address the dangers of operatives doing this and to provide instruction on the correct procedures.",30/09/2019,"£1,280.00","£3,461.00","Dealercast, Barton Hall/ChristBarton HallHardy StreetMANCHESTERM30 7NBEngland",North West,Salford,Manufacturing,25990 - MF FABRICATED METAL PROD NEC,Fixed,FODOP2GP6,Field Operations Division,,North West,2022-05-17 12:41:24.615456+00:00
