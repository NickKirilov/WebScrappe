4629127,Albis (UK) Limited,"Prosecution of Albis (UK) Limited after an employee’s hand was trapped in machinery whilst attempting to remove a blockage. An operative was filling an autoloader machine when a blockage occurred in the chute preventing the product from dropping into the mixer. The operative opened the mixer in order to insert their hand into the chute to remove the blockage, at which point, the butterfly valve was released causing the index finger of their right hand to be trapped.   The investigation by HSE found that the company had made alterations to the roof area of the premises sometime before the incident. Due to these the length of the chute had been decreased making access to dangerous parts of the machine possible. A risk assessment had not been carried out subsequent to the shortening of the chute neither had operatives been fully instructed on how to unblock the autoloader. The machine had also been reconfigured unbeknown to the safety manager, allowing the valve to continue moving when the interlock had been broken: The machine should have cut out when the mixer lid was opened, which it failed to do.",12/10/2018,"£33,000.00","£3,684.62",Parkgate Ind.Estate/Albis (UK)Parkgate Ind EstateKNUTSFORDCheshireWA16 8XWEngland,North West,Cheshire East UA,Manufacturing,22290 - MF OF OTHER PLASTIC PRODUCTS,Fixed,FODOP2GP7,Field Operations Division,,North West,1652956687.7641695
