4684699,Goodwin Steel Castings Ltd,"Prosecution of Goodwin Steel Castings Ltd following an accident investigation.
A 51-year-old male furnace operative sustained serious burns (33%) to many areas of his body following an ejection of molten slag during a slagging off procedure.

The slag was being poured from a 10-tonne capacity furnace into a receptacle known as a slag pan. After approx. 90 seconds of pouring, the eruption took place, with molten material contacting the majority of the left-hand side of the IP’s body.

The most likely explanation for the incident is that undetected water had entered the pan which had been stored incorrectly (open face up) in the yard during a period of inclement weather. Water expands violently upon contact with molten metal/slag.

It is likely that rainwater had accumulated underneath a solidified metal ‘skull’ (formed as a result of previous use) & would not be visible to the naked eye

The systems in place for the safe storage & use of slag pans were subequently found to be defficient in a number of respects, most appropriately dealt with by a s2(1) HSWA breach.",21/02/2020,"£133,000.00","£5,226.30",Ivy House Road/Goodwin Steel CIvy House RoadHanleySTOKE ON TRENTStaffordshireST1 3NREngland,Midlands,Stoke-on-Trent,Manufacturing,24520 - CASTING OF STEEL,Fixed,FODOP8GP35,Field Operations Division,,West Midlands,1652956705.5824027
