4637481,Aqua Logistics Limited,"Highly contaminated air had been produced, stored and sold by Aqua Logistics Limited to YU Diving Limited on 26th June 2017. The subsequent use of the air by school children from Manchester Grammar School had ‘life threatening’ consequences. 
The contamination arose from a fire in a poorly maintained compressor filtration system. The investigation revealed several contraventions under subordinate regulations that indicate that the compressor, filtration and pressure system had not been properly installed, maintained and operated in a safe manner. A carbon monoxide monitor supplied with the compressor and filtration system that the investigators had demonstrated would have effectively shut down the compressor when the CO levels rose to dangerous levels was isolated from the filtration system and had not been used since installation.
The subject compressor and associated pressure system was poorly situated being located near a paint spray booth and stored chemicals. The installation site was poorly ventilated with potential for overheating and was situated in a contaminated air environment.
There was no evidence provided to show Aqua Logistics employees had access to the theoretical knowledge and actual experience, to demonstrate competence to undertake system design changes and modifications.
There was a severe lack of planned preventative maintenance and instructions for the subject compressor and associated pressure system and this means maintenance staff were unaware of certain required tasks.
No written scheme of examination was prepared for the subject compressor and associated pressure system those personnel carrying out maintenance or modifications, inspection and examination would not be aware of the critical parts of the system which could give rise to danger.
Due to poor location, the lack of maintenance and no examination under a written scheme there existed a foreseeable risk of contaminated air being produced by the subject compressor and associated pressure system and a potential for the unintentional release of stored energy.
