4677867,Sovereign Group Ltd,"Prosecution of Sovereign Group Ltd after a worker was crushed whilst assisting to move and locate a stack of three stillages weighing 3000 kg.  The worker with two other employees was locating the stillages, loaded on a side loader, into a gap in the aisle of the despatch area. Whilst manoeuvring the stillages away from the aisle to make another attempt to push the stillages into the gap the stack of three stillages fell over onto the employee. The investigation by HSE found that Sovereign Group Ltd had no formal safe system of work in place and the operatives had developed their own system for swapping stillages which involved unsafe lifting operations. The method adopted by the company was not safe and employees were not adequately trained or instructed. The despatch area was heavily congested at the time of the incident and poorly laid out for the stillages to be stored safely.",09/01/2020,"£33,333.00","£5,191.58",Vale Street/Sovereign Group LtVale StreetNELSONLancashireBB9 0TAEngland,North West,Pendle,Manufacturing,22230 - MF BUILDERS’ WARE PLASTIC,Fixed,FODOP2GP7,Field Operations Division,,North West,2022-05-16 15:07:12.575336+00:00
