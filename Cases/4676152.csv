4676152,TA Knox Shopfitters Ltd,"Prosecution of  T A Knox Shopfitters after an employee suffered multiple fractures after falling fifteen feet from scaffolding. The employee was boxing in the newly installed roller shutter at the front of a shop in the Trafford Centre. Whilst screwing up a soffit board, the scaffold moved and threw him off balance, causing him to fall backwards against the safety rail of the tower scaffold which gave way resulting in the fall. The  investigation by HSE found that the safety rail had not been clipped in correctly, causing it to give way when the employee fell against it. Had there been suitable and sufficient edge protection and qualified people on site to erect a tower scaffold, the accident could have been prevented.",24/10/2019,"£18,000.00","£4,623.42",47-49 Peel AveTrafford CentreManchesterGreater ManchesterM17 8BNEngland,North West,Trafford,Manufacturing,16290 - WOOD/CORK/STRAW/PLAITING PROD,,CDOP2GP8,Construction Division,,North West,1652956733.897981
