4630807,Princess Yachts Limited,"Employee suffered minor injuries when a forklift truck was struck by a load on a flatbed lorry while carrying out a tandem lift operation, which caused the forklift truck to overturn. The lifting operation had not been planned or properly risk assessed, the employees had not been properly trained and did not have access to a safe system of work. There were basic procedures in place for the operation however employees were not aware of these procedures. There was a reasonably practicable option not to use fork lift trucks for this activity which had not been considered. This incident could have resulted in serious or fatal injury.",03/08/2018,"£200,000.00","£7,138.20",Princess Yachts LimitedLangage SitePlymouthDevonPL7 5EUEngland,Wales & South West,Plymouth UA,Manufacturing,30110 - BLD SHIPS/FLOATING STRUCTURES,,FODOP9GP37,Field Operations Division,,South West,1652956725.4147742
