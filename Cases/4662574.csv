4662574,Thomas Dean,"Prosecution of Thomas Dean after an employee of Grayton Building Contractors Ltd fell five meters whilst working on a first-floor extension to a residential bungalow. The injured person employed by Graytons was fitting fascia boards and soffits to allow roofers, employed by Mr. T Dean to commence work. Whilst stepping across a gap in the incomplete working platform to descend from the roof, the ladder, which was not tied, slipped sideways, causing him to fall. The investigation by HSE found that both Grayton Building Contractors Ltd and the roofing contractor Mr. Thomas Dean failed to properly plan the work, to assess the risks and to provide appropriate supervision.  The work at height equipment selected was not suitable and the work was not carried out safely.",11/06/2018,£400.00,"£3,000.00",Noel GateOrmskirkLancashireL39England,North West,West Lancashire,Construction,41100 - DEVELOPMENT BUILDING PROJECTS,,CDOP2GP7,Construction Division,,North West,1652956734.9082656
