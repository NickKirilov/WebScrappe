The operative had switched off the screw at the control panel but  not at the main electricity supply. After cleaning the screw the operative went to replace it, however the power had inadvertently been turned back on, and the screw began to operate on coming into contact with the drive motor. The investigation by HSE found that the company had no risk assessments or safe systems of work in place and did not provide staff with adequate training or make them aware of the dangers associated with the machinery being cleaned.",13/09/2019,"£70,000.00","£5,080.80","Webber Est/Applied Nutrition LUnit 17, Webber EstatesWebber RoadLIVERPOOLL33 7SQEngland",North West,Knowsley,Manufacturing,10860 - MF HOMOGENISED/DIETETIC FOOD,Fixed,FODOP2GP8,Field Operations Division,,North West,1652956688.9018712
