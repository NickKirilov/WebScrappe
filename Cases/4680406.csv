4680406,Pearl Services U.K. Limited,"Prosecution of Pearl Services Ltd after an employee suffered significant sight loss in the right eye during work on a refurbishment project. Employees were erecting PVC hoarding within a store to separate the refurbishment work area from members of the public.  The injured employee struck one of the PVC panels using a mallet, causing it to splinter resulting in a fragment penetrating their right eye.  The investigation by HSE found that the company had failed to suitably plan, manage and monitor the project. Risk assessments and method statements had not fully identified the need to wear safety eyewear during the erection of the hoarding. The supervisor had failed to ensure that the documentation available on-site was communicated to the operatives before commencing work. Although safety eyewear was available on site, the wearing of it had not been made mandatory, neither were checks carried out to ensure it was worn.",23/02/2020,"£16,000.00","£5,778.40",Manchester Fort Shopping CentrManchesterGreater ManchesterM8 8EPEngland,North West,Manchester,Construction,42990 - CIVIL ENGINEERING PROJECT NEC.,,CDOP2GP8,Construction Division,,North West,1652956723.1040254
