4653479,Ultimate Systems (NW) Limited,"Prosecution of Ultimate Systems (NW) Limited after a delivery driver was crushed by a poorly lifted load.  An HGV driver was delivering several packs of 5m length plastic deck boards. The decking was stacked on pallets with an approximate weight of over 2000 kgs. Company director Andrew Kerr used a forklift truck (FLT) to unload the delivery, lifting the entire stack of pallets, which exceeded the FLT load capacity at once, causing the forklift to tip forward which resulted in the load falling onto the HGV driver, trapping him between the load and his own vehicle. The investigation by HSE found Mr Kerr was not trained to operate the forklift truck. And the company had no safe system of work for unloading/loading of decking, and no rules for visiting drivers to wait in a safe area.",03/04/2019,"£38,000.00","£3,741.10","Poynton Ind Est/Ultimate SysteUnit 4, Poynton Industrial EstSTOCKPORTCheshireSK12 1NDEngland",North West,Cheshire East UA,Construction,43999 - SPECIALISED CONST NOT SCAFFOLD,Fixed,FODOP2GP7,Field Operations Division,,North West,1652956737.310986
