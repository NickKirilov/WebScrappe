4704062,R. Briggs Sheetmetal Fabrications Limited,"Prosecution of R.Briggs Sheetmetal Fabrications Ltd after an employee’s hand was drawn into the rotating parts of a machine. An apprentice received instruction from another apprentice and a trainee on how to operate a swaging machine.  This consisted of two rotating wheels controlled by a foot pedal, used to put a groove around a ducting tube.  After carrying this process out on approximately four pieces of tubing, the apprentice was  left to proceed on their own, unsupervised.  Whilst continuing the task a fabric safety glove worn by the apprentice  caught in the rotating wheels of the machine. On releasing the foot pedal, the wheels took a few seconds to stop, drawing the apprentices hand between them. An investigation by HSE found that the company had not performed a risk assessment for using the machine or implemented any safe systems of work including that the gloves presented a drawing-in and entanglement hazard on that machine.  They did not provide staff with adequate training or assess the additional risks due to young person lacking experience working with machinery and being unaware of existing or potential risks which could have prevented the incident.",14/10/2019,"£13,000.00","£2,682.65",Unit 2/R.
