D P M Industrial Roofing (UK) Ltd,"Prosecution results from an investigation into an accident that occurred on the 1st March 2017 at the premises of PD Edenhall at Pleasant Street, Burslem.  

DPM faces a charge under Section 2 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 for failing to ensure the health and safety of its employees, including  the IP  in relation to the risks arising whilst working at height.   

An employee of  DPM sustained serious injuries when he fell through a fragile roof of the premises whilst undertaking roof repairs.  The work involved the clearing of the two valley gutters and the boundary wall gutter to the left of unit 4, followed by over-sheeting 6 damaged asbestos roof sheets with corrugated metal sheets. 

There was a complete failure to identify the risk posed by walking along the relatively narrow gutters in close proximity to fragile roof surfaces on either side of those gutters.This meant employees were walking a distance of 35 metres from one end of the roof to the other without any means in place to prevent them falling through the roof should they slip or trip, or to mitigate the consequences of any fall.

The method of work that the men had been told to adopt whilst over sheeting was to use crawling boards which is the method the IP was following when his accident occurred. Those crawling boards however did not have guardrails attached which meant that the men were being exposed to the avoidable risk of a fall from the same or from inadvertently stepping off the same.

The risks posed  during the work could have been dealt with properly had tDPM followed the basic industry guidance set out in the freely available HSE publication HSG 33 – Health and Safety in Roof Work.",01/03/2017,"£10,000.00","£6,454.68",2022-05-05 14:35:40.846962+00:00
