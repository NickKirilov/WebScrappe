4592071,Lancs & Cumbria Lifts UK Ltd,"Prosecution of Lancs and Cumbria Lifts UK Ltd after a care home resident was fatally injured when a lift plunged to the basement. A resident of Serendipity Care Home. and an employee  entered the lift which began to descend but stopped after a few seconds as the corner of a damaged door caught on the lintel plate of the ground floor landing entrance, causing it to bend. The lift subsequently dropped 4m to the basement, resulting in fatal injuries to the resident and injuries to the employee. An investigation by HSE found that mechanical repairs had not been carried out in accordance with good engineering practice and maintenance was of a poor standard. Despite being fully aware of ongoing issues with the lift, the care home director did not ensure that there was a system in place to deal with reports of defects and ensure action was taken in response to issues identified. 
Whilst Thorough Examination reports had been carried out every 6 months as required by law, these had not been provided by Premum Care Ltd, the home owner, to Lancs &Cumbria Lifts Ltd,  nor requested by the lift company to inform maintenance work. If communication had been better and Lancs and Cumbria Lifts UK Ltd had been in receipt of the reports, which repeatedly reported faults which were similarly not actioned, further opportunity would have been afforded to carry out the necessary repairs earlier and prevent this tragic incident occurring.",30/01/2017,"£14,400.00","£45,000.00",22a Greenfield AvenueManchesterGreater ManchesterM41 0XNEngland,North West,Trafford,Total service industries,46690 - WHOLESALE NEC M/CRY/EQUIPMENT,,FODOP2GP6,Field Operations Division,,North West,2022-05-17 12:41:41.405734+00:00
