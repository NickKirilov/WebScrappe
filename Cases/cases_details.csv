The investigation by HSE found that the company had made alterations to the roof area of the premises sometime before the incident. Due to these the length of the chute had been decreased making access to dangerous parts of the machine possible. A risk assessment had not been carried out subsequent to the shortening of the chute neither had operatives been fully instructed on how to unblock the autoloader.

Company director Andrew Kerr used a forklift truck (FLT) to unload the delivery, lifting the entire stack of pallets, which exceeded the FLT load capacity at once, causing the forklift to tip forward which resulted in the load falling onto the HGV driver, trapping him between the load and his own vehicle.

4486403,Apache Beryl I Limited,"Production operations personnel on the installation commenced a work task involving the depressurisation (venting) of a platform well annulus to the separation system on gas lift well number A86.  The production technician allocated to, and in the execution of, this task proceeded to configure, and lock open, certain wellhead valves, including the Production Wing Valve, which meant that ESD (Emergency Shutdown Down) functionality was no longer available on demand should an emergency shutdown of the plant be required.  Shortly after the task had commenced a hydrocarbon release (HCR) occurred when a section of smallbore tubing located downstream failed. The GPA (General Platform Alarm) sounded and the deluge activated in the area. Normally during an incident of this nature the process systems blow down through the flare in approximately 15-20 minutes.  However, as the production wing valve was locked open it could not close on ESD activation. The Offshore Installation Manager considered abandonment of the platform as he thought that the gas release may have developed into an uncontrollable release, as the plant was not blowing down on demand as expected, and the information that he had received from production personnel involved in the task led him to believe that both the A86 well annulus and tubing were live to the flow line and the wellhead valves were not forming a well barrier.  However, gas levels did recede gradually and the OIM stood down the platform muster after over 6 ½ hours. 

The size of the gas release associated with this incident has been estimated  as 1035 kg. Apache's key failure is that of failing to provide a safe system of work or procedure for venting gas lift wells.",02/06/2014,"£400,000.00",£0.00,"Beryl A/Apache BerylLine 1, QTY, NQAGBR",,Not Applicable,Extractive and utility supply industries,06100 - EXTRACTION OF CRUDE PETROLEUM,Offshore Safety Directive Regulator,EDHOU7S,Energy Division,,,2022-05-20 17:55:15.351167

4637481,Aqua Logistics Limited,"Highly contaminated air had been produced, stored and sold by Aqua Logistics Limited to YU Diving Limited on 26th June 2017. The subsequent use of the air by school children from Manchester Grammar School had ‘life threatening’ consequences. 
The contamination arose from a fire in a poorly maintained compressor filtration system. The investigation revealed several contraventions under subordinate regulations that indicate that the compressor, filtration and pressure system had not been properly installed, maintained and operated in a safe manner. A carbon monoxide monitor supplied with the compressor and filtration system that the investigators had demonstrated would have effectively shut down the compressor when the CO levels rose to dangerous levels was isolated from the filtration system and had not been used since installation.
The subject compressor and associated pressure system was poorly situated being located near a paint spray booth and stored chemicals. The installation site was poorly ventilated with potential for overheating and was situated in a contaminated air environment.
There was no evidence provided to show Aqua Logistics employees had access to the theoretical knowledge and actual experience, to demonstrate competence to undertake system design changes and modifications.
There was a severe lack of planned preventative maintenance and instructions for the subject compressor and associated pressure system and this means maintenance staff were unaware of certain required tasks.
No written scheme of examination was prepared for the subject compressor and associated pressure system those personnel carrying out maintenance or modifications, inspection and examination would not be aware of the critical parts of the system which could give rise to danger.
Due to poor location, the lack of maintenance and no examination under a written scheme there existed a foreseeable risk of contaminated air being produced by the subject compressor and associated pressure system and a potential for the unintentional release of stored energy.

4684699,Goodwin Steel Castings Ltd,"Prosecution of Goodwin Steel Castings Ltd following an accident investigation.
A 51-year-old male furnace operative sustained serious burns (33%) to many areas of his body following an ejection of molten slag during a slagging off procedure.

The slag was being poured from a 10-tonne capacity furnace into a receptacle known as a slag pan. After approx. 90 seconds of pouring, the eruption took place, with molten material contacting the majority of the left-hand side of the IP’s body.

The most likely explanation for the incident is that undetected water had entered the pan which had been stored incorrectly (open face up) in the yard during a period of inclement weather. Water expands violently upon contact with molten metal/slag.

It is likely that rainwater had accumulated underneath a solidified metal ‘skull’ (formed as a result of previous use) & would not be visible to the naked eye

The systems in place for the safe storage & use of slag pans were subequently found to be defficient in a number of respects, most appropriately dealt with by a s2(1) HSWA breach.",21/02/2020,"£133,000.00","£5,226.30",Ivy House Road/Goodwin Steel CIvy House RoadHanleySTOKE ON TRENTStaffordshireST1 3NREngland,Midlands,Stoke-on-Trent,Manufacturing,24520 - CASTING OF STEEL,Fixed,FODOP8GP35,Field Operations Division,,West Midlands,2022-05-20 17:55:37.147524

It was also found that dedicated training and a full risk assessment and care plan for that individual were not undertaken by Options for Supported Living in order to identify the triggers for violence and aggression and how the risk could be managed.  The need for 2.1 supervision, triggers (things not to say or do) should have been identified and copies of the documents given to Options employees prior to their visits.

The need for 2.1 supervision, triggers (things not to say or do) should have been identified and copies of the documents given to Options employees prior to their visits.

Mr. Allen, a self-employed contractor trading as A&E Property Services, replaced a boiler at a property in Winsford  Following the installation, a number of problems arose including losses of pressure and water leaks. In August 2019, a Gas Safe Registered engineer attended the property and discovered multiple issues with the installation including an inadequately sized pipe, which they felt posed immediate danger. An investigation by HSE found that Robert Allen had never been Gas Safe Registered, despite providing a Gas Safety check to do work on a property prior to this incident. It was discovered that he had provided himself with a false registration number and had also used the registration number of a company completely unconnected with him. On the inspection of the work carried out, five separate serious defects were found including an unsealed flue, a pressure relief valve incorrectly located, undersized gas pipework, uncommissioned appliance and corrosion to the gas pipework. These could have led to carbon monoxide leakage, scalding, unsafe combustion, and unburned gas release respectively, which could have proved fatal.",11/01/2019,£0.00,"£5,263.04",Station RoadWinsfordCheshireCW7 3DFEngland,North West,Cheshire West and Chester UA,Construction,43220 - INSTALL PLUMB/HEAT/AIR-CON,,FODOP2GP8,Field Operations Division,,North West,2022-05-20 17:56:02.357412
