Risk assessments and method statements had not fully identified the need to wear safety eyewear during the erection of the hoarding. The supervisor had failed to ensure that the documentation available on-site was communicated to the operatives before commencing work. Although safety eyewear was available on site, the wearing of it had not been made mandatory, neither were checks carried out to ensure it was worn.",23/02/2020,"£16,000.00","£5,778.40",2022-05-05 16:12:20.371196+00:00
