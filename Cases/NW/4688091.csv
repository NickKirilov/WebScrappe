Robert Allen,"Prosecution of Robert Allen after undertaking gas work on a property whilst not being gas safe registered.  Mr. Allen, a self-employed contractor trading as A&E Property Services, replaced a boiler at a property in Winsford  Following the installation, a number of problems arose including losses of pressure and water leaks. In August 2019, a Gas Safe Registered engineer attended the property and discovered multiple issues with the installation including an inadequately sized pipe, which they felt posed immediate danger. An investigation by HSE found that Robert Allen had never been Gas Safe Registered, despite providing a Gas Safety check to do work on a property prior to this incident. It was discovered that he had provided himself with a false registration number and had also used the registration number of a company completely unconnected with him. On the inspection of the work carried out, five separate serious defects were found including an unsealed flue, a pressure relief valve incorrectly located, undersized gas pipework, uncommissioned appliance and corrosion to the gas pipework. These could have led to carbon monoxide leakage, scalding, unsafe combustion, and unburned gas release respectively, which could have proved fatal.",11/01/2019,£0.00,"£5,263.04",2022-05-05 16:12:22.176381+00:00
