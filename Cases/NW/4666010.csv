Barrowbridge Construction Ltd,"Prosecution of Barrowbridge Construction Limited after an employee was hit by falling debris whilst demolishing a garage. On the second day on site the operatives decided that it would be safer to push the remaining wall over.  This change to the method of work was made without consultation with the project manager and resulted in the operatives working in an unsafe area, putting themselves at risk of being struck by falling materials. The wall collapsed in two directions and struck one of the operatives.  The HSE investigation found that the demolition was not planned or carried out in a manner to prevent danger.  
The risk assessments and method statement prepared by Barrowbridge Construction Ltd required the use of hand tools, including sledgehammers, to demolish the walls of the garage.  No measures were identified or implemented which would maintain the stability of the wall throughout the demolition, resulting in a risk that the structure would become unstable and potentially collapse.",10/01/2020,£600.00,"£1,947.00",2022-05-05 16:12:10.481988+00:00
