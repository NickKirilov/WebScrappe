Countrywide Freight Group Limited,"Prosecution of Countrywide Freight Group Ltd after two workers were employed loading pallets on to a curtain sided trailer. The workers were both standing on the trailer bed with the agency worker passing loose boxes to the employee, who was placing them on top of pallets of goods already loaded. Two hours after he arrived on site the agency worker stepped backwards and fell off the trailer bed approximately 1.38m to the ground below.  The injured person was in hospital for ten days following an operation. HSE investigation found that if the loose boxes had been consolidated on a pallet then loaded with a forklift truck, the workers would not have needed to stand on the bed of the trailer to load the boxes manually, and the accident could have been avoided. The Company did not have a safe system of work for loading trailers based on a suitable and sufficient risk assessment.",03/05/2019,"£112,000.00","£5,904.30",2022-05-05 16:12:11.882940+00:00
