Ruttle Plant (Birmingham ) Limited,"Prosecution of Ruttle Plant (Birmingham) Ltd for leaving workers at risk of a fall from height, and not providing minimum welfare facilities.  The company was in the process of building a new aggregate recycling facility. Part of the work included the provision of  cladding to the roof which was  carried out from a cherry picker. As some areas of the roof were difficult to reach, employees had to step onto the roof where no edge protection had been provided, putting them at risk of a 30ft fall . In addition, workers had been on site for some considerable time without the minimum required welfare facilities being available. This included facilities for hand washing during the height of the Covid pandemic.   An investigation by HSE found that the workers had been left unsupervised by site management, there had been no method statement to follow when they climbed onto the roof  and there were no preventative measures in place to prevent the risk of a fall from height. Workers were also expected to drive to the company’s head office along an unadopted roadway over five minutes’ drive away to use the toilet despite there being ample room on the site for facilities.",12/11/2020,"£66,667.00","£1,847.29",2022-05-05 16:12:23.091488+00:00
