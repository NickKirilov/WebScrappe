Improvement Notice,"Improvement Notice served,

You have failed to prevent or adequately control the exposure of persons to plastic fume, which contains substances hazardous to health, emitted from Batch Ovens A & B. During my visit I heard that the ovens can emit significant amounts of plastic fume and that some concern and health effects have been noted. You have recognised the health hazard in a risk assessment and that further control is required but I understand that only limited progress has been made in implementing controls. The only current control listed in your risk assessment is the use of RPE (respiratory protective equipment); engineering controls should be prioritised over RPE.",25/02/2022,,Complied with,2022-05-05 16:10:22.687079+00:00
