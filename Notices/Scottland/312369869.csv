Improvement Notice,"I carried out an onshore headquarters inspection during February 2022 of your installation integrity management arrangements used to manage your offshore installations Ninian South (NSP), Ninian Central (NCP) and Tiffany (Tiff). The following Process Safety Management (PSM) integrity trends were indicating a potential increase in operating risk:
•	High-risk Materials and Corrosion Defect Reports (MCDRs) from Jan’21 to Feb’22 have increased from 131 to 262.
•	Number of moderate-high to high risk items has been maintained at 700-800 approximately over the last 18 months.

Upon further inspection of your integrity management arrangements, I identified a number of deficiencies in relation to your maintenance management strategy, processes, planning & execution including:
•	Your strategy for managing external corrosion on the firewater pipe work systems on NSP and NCP had become one of wholesale replacement rather than localised repair such is the level of degradation. 
•	An increased reliance on defined life repairs (DLRs) over the last five years on all three installations.
•	Poor management processes in place for ensuring that suitable inspections of defined life repairs were carried out at the required intervals, in order to verify fitness for continued safe operation.
•	The NSP dead leg register contained a significant number of lines that had not been inspected, some that were inspected over five years ago and appeared overdue whilst approaching minimum wall thickness for safe operation.
•	During February 2022 for planning of MCDR remediation work on all three installations, of the 247,000 offshore execution hours requested, only 211,000 hours had been endorsed.

As a result of the above, you have failed to make and give effect to such arrangements as are appropriate for the effective organisation, control, monitoring and review of the preventive and protective measures for managing your installation integrity risks on your aforementioned installations.",30/09/2022,,Ongoing,2022-05-05 16:06:30.321077+00:00
