Improvement Notice,"You had not ensured that such ground control measures were taken as necessary to keep secure every place in the mine where persons work or pass. On 6th October 2021 a sudden and uncontrolled rock/roof fall of approximately 150 tonnes occurred at 2N junction in area 4 at the mine. The junction span at 2N measured 14.3m exceeding the maximum design span for the mine of 12m and the rock fell from the roof around a tell-tale device installed to monitor for ground movement in accordance with your ground support system design to give warning of such events. Six of the eight supporting pillars adjacent to the collapsed junction were of smaller cross-section than that stated in your support design document.
You have not made a suitable and sufficient review of your assessment of the risks of ground movement for excavations in the mine with regard to the risks from delamination of the strata in the roof where roadway excavation operations have exceeded the planned extraction width, blasting and where changes in the nature of the roof strata in the geological structure may be present. You had not, where appropriate, revised the assessment of the risks of ground movement for excavations in the mine related to such risks and you had not ensured that sufficient ground control measures were taken to address effectively those risks.",25/02/2022,30/05/2022,Ongoing,2022-05-05 14:22:03.202096+00:00
