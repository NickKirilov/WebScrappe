Improvement Notice,"312136614 - You have failed to ensure that the risk of fire and / or explosion is either eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable in that the vent for Mixing Tank L terminates inside Mixing Room 2 and therefore there is the risk of flammable and / or explosive atmospheres forming in the mixing room and the potential for a fire and / or explosion to occur resulting in serious injury or death.

312136678 - You have failed to ensure that the risk of fire and / or explosion is either eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable in that the vent for Mixing Tank M terminates inside Mixing Room 2 and therefore there is the risk of flammable and / or explosive atmospheres forming in the mixing room and the potential for a fire and / or explosion to occur resulting in serious injury or death.

312136775 - You have failed to ensure that the risk of fire and / or explosion is either eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable in that the vent for Mixing Tank N terminates inside Mixing Room 2 and therefore there is the risk of flammable and / or explosive atmospheres forming in the mixing room and the potential for a fire and / or explosion to occur resulting in serious injury or death.

312136794 - You have failed to ensure that the risk of fire and / or explosion is either eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable in that the vent for Mixing Tank Q terminates inside Mixing Room 2 and therefore there is the risk of flammable and / or explosive atmospheres forming in the mixing room and the potential for a fire and / or explosion to occur resulting in serious injury or death.

312136844 - You have failed to ensure that the risk of fire and / or explosion is either eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable in that the vent for Mixing Tank R terminates inside Mixing Room 2 and therefore there is the risk of flammable and / or explosive atmospheres forming in the mixing room and the potential for a fire and / or explosion to occur resulting in serious injury or death.

312136899 - You have failed to ensure that the risk of fire and / or explosion is either eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable in that the vent for Mixing Tank S terminates inside Mixing Room 2 and therefore there is the risk of flammable and / or explosive atmospheres forming in the mixing room and the potential for a fire and / or explosion to occur resulting in serious injury or death.

312136900 - You have failed to ensure that the risk of fire and / or explosion is either eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable in Mixing Room 1. Specifically, you have failed to provide adequate local exhaust ventilation, suitably positioned, to prevent or minimise potentially unsafe concentrations of flammable and/or explosive vapours into Mixing Room 1 when flammable liquid product (above flashpoint of solvents and at temperatures above ambient) is pumped or emptied by gravity out of mixing tanks into drums.

312136903 - You have failed to ensure that the risk of fire and / or explosion is either eliminated or reduced so far as is reasonably practicable in Mixing Room 2. Specifically, you have failed to provide adequate local exhaust ventilation, suitably positioned, to prevent or minimise potentially unsafe concentrations of flammable and/or explosive vapours into Mixing Room 2 when flammable liquid product (above flashpoint of solvents and at temperatures above ambient) is pumped or emptied by gravity out of mixing tanks into drums.

312136912 - You have failed to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks to employees which arise from dangerous substances which are, or are liable to be, present at the workplace.",05/05/2022,,Ongoing,2022-05-05 16:07:40.760571+00:00
