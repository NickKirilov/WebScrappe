Improvement Notice,"I carried out an inspection of the Gryphon A installation, a late life Floating and Production Storage and
Offloading Vessel, between 06 - 08 October 2021, during which I followed up on commitments given in your written response to my previous inspection in respect to your management of inspection and maintenance backlogs. During this inspection it was seen that the number of manhours you require to complete the outstanding safety and environmental critical element (SECE) maintenance and inspection work orders in backlog has further increased from around 7,000 on 31 October 2020 to over 11,000 on 30 September 2021, of which around 3,700 were categorised as ‘Unmanaged’. You have identified an Asset Integrity Key Performance Indicator for ‘Unmanaged’ to be less than 405 manhours. The total maintenance and inspection backlog, including outstanding non-SECE work orders, has similarly increased during this period and was found to be over 34,000 manhours as of 30 September 2021. Therefore, you have failed to make and give effect to such arrangements as are appropriate for the effective organisation, control, monitoring and review of the preventive and protective measures to avoid the risk from an increasing inspection and maintenance backlog significantly in excess of your own safety assurance targets for Gryphon A.",30/06/2022,,Ongoing,2022-05-05 16:08:26.809982+00:00
