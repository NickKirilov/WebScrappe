Improvement Notice,"You are failing to ensure the health and safety of your employees and others not in your employment from the risk of injury arising from collision between attendant platform supply vessels (PSVs) and your mobile offshore installation in that you are failing to implement a safe system of work to control vessel operations within the 500 metre safety zone around the installation so as to ensure that the risk of such collision is reduced to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. On 17 November 2021, you undertook cargo
transfer operations with the PSV ""Ben Nevis"" with the vessel on the drift-on side of Ensco 92 where both the wind and current were pushing Ben Nevis towards Ensco 92, without a suitable and sufficient risk assessment and without having in place reasonably practicable safeguards such as implementing maximimum environmental limits for drift-on working, such that when the vessel attempted to comply with a request to change position it was no longer able to maintain position and, by a combination of wind and current, was pushed onto the forward leg of Ensco 92 where it sustained significant damage leading to it taking on water and having to return to port for repairs. The manner in which you performed the marine operation was contrary to your clients marine operations procedures, the vessels operating procedures, and recognised marine industry practice and guidelines, which advise that ""risk of collision can be reduced by
avoiding weather side working unless absolutely necessary and only under tight control after a risk assessment involving the vessel master and the OIM"" and ""Any requirement to work on the weatherside of a facility must be risk assessed prior to moving into the set-up position. It shall be continuously reassessed until the relevant operations have been completed.""",31/03/2022,,Ongoing,2022-05-05 14:21:26.086817+00:00
