In that your ‘2020 Claymore Xmas Tree and Valve Report Form April 2020’ identifies that wells 14/19-C81 & 14/19-C84 Upper Master Valves had failed to close on demand in May 2020 during routine integrity testing.  These valves also failed to close during emergency shut down testing as per Verification report: ABN-2021-RSRUK-CLA-ESD-01 April 2021. 

Your ‘2020 Claymore Xmas Tree and Valve Report Form April 2020’ identifies 14/19-C81 has an additional failure in the Flow Wing Valve.  This failure was also recorded in June 2021 on ‘Claymore Xmas Tree and Valve Report Form June 2021’.
