Improvement Notice,"You have failed to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks to the health and safety of your employees and persons not in your employment arising out of your undertaking to decommission wells on the Brent Charlie using the East Hydraulic Workover Unit (HWU) and the Control Cutter unit.  

My investigation revealed your assessments for the cut and recovery phase of the 13-3/8” and 20” casing failed to identify the risk of lifting equipment failure and the consequences of a dropped object from the HWU workbasket.  As such you did not determine likelihood and severity of harm occurring, who might be harmed, and any suitable control measures necessary to manage the risk from a dropped section of casing.

As a result, at approximately 23:40 on 23 August 2021 the lifting equipment on the East Hydraulic Workover Unit failed immediately after cutting a section of combined 20” & 13-3/8” casing strings, causing a section of casing string of approximately 36 foot in length and 3.3Te in weight to fall approximately 50 feet from the top of HWU work basket, that had significant potential to cause a major accident.",29/10/2021,21/12/2021,Complied with,2022-05-05 14:22:27.370019+00:00
