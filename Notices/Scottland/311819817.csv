Improvement Notice,"Forties D IN PFEER 6(1) served 26/08/2021 as there was an uncontrolled hydrocarbon gas release from a pressure transmitter (PIT21K58D) on K58 compressor whilst it was running through start-up on 13 March 2021. Process trends, which were readily available to the operations team at the time of the release, showed that the pressure in the system was over 10barg at the point of making the decision to send personnel to the equipment to investigate, and were at approximately 10bar at the time personnel arrived at the release site. You allowed personnel to approach a hazardous location even though their presence was not required to enable safe control of the situation.

The OIM, and the Operations Supervisor investigated the release themselves whilst it was ongoing, with an Instrument technician, and these three and others ended up quite close to a pressurised gas release site. This risked compromising key personnel in the emergency chain of command, who are trained to perform specific command and control duties.",30/12/2021,,Complied with,2022-05-05 14:22:31.228010+00:00
