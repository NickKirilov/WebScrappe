Improvement Notice,"During my inspection of Magnus installation between 1st and 3rd November 2021, I found that you were periodically draining the liquid hydrocarbons collected in the Cold relief flare boot to open hazardous drains. The activity inherently involves releasing hydrocarbons in Module 1 of Magnus installation and you rely upon procedural controls to minimize the volume of hydrocarbons released to atmosphere. You have not designed out the hazards by providing an inherently safe arrangement for draining hydrocarbons to an enclosed system. Therefore, you have failed to take appropriate measures with a view to preventing fire and explosion, including such measures to ensure safe handling and treatment of flammable substances.",17/12/2021,31/10/2022,Ongoing,2022-05-05 16:08:06.396893+00:00
