You have failed to ensure that electrical equipment, namely a 'SY' type flexible cable supplying the motor of the ice raking mechanism within the ice production plant, is of such construction or as necessary protected as to prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, danger arising from the exposure of the said equipment to mechanical stress (impact, strain, abrasion or wear) or the effects of temperature in that; the cable type in use is not suitable for temperatures below -5C in flexible applications and, has not been provided with suitable mechanical protection.

IN/SPD011121/02-312001243
You have operated the pressure system associated with the ‘Geneglace’ ice making machine without a written scheme for periodic examination by a competent person, covering the following parts of the system; a) all protective devices b) every pressure vessel (such as the refrigerant receiver serial number 0209136) and every pipeline in which a defect may give rise to danger c) those parts of the pipework in which a defect may give rise to danger, being in place.

IN/SPD011121/03-312001256
You have failed to take appropriate measures to ensure that the re-connection of the electrical supply to the ice raking mechanism of the ice production plant does not expose any person using the work equipment i.e.; entering the container housing the ice raking machinery for cleaning or fault-finding purposes, to any risk to their health or safety in that; you have failed to establish procedures setting out how secure isolation can be achieved for the said equipment and you have failed to provide the equipment required, such as appropriate locking devices, to do so.

IN/SPD011121/04 - 312001292
You have failed to establish the necessary emergency procedures, suitable warning and other communication systems, required to protect the health of those employees operating the ‘Geneglace’ ice production plant, and others who may thereby be affected, from an accident, incident or emergency related to the presence of R449A refrigerant (containing 1,1,1,2-TETRAFLUOROETHANE, which is a substance hazardous to health as defined by the above regulations) which is used in the plant.",29/11/2021,05/05/2022,Ongoing,2022-05-05 16:08:13.952053+00:00
