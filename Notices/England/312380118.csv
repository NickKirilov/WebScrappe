Improvement Notice,"You have not ensured so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in your employment who may be 
affected by your undertaking are not exposed to risks to their health or safety, as you have not prevented 
people from falling into the basement a distance liable to cause personal injury, as the edges of the 
basement, which are very close to the site perimeter have not been protected. Substantial and suitable 
barriers/guardrails around the excavation have not been used
1x in servedIn the interest of health and safety suitable and sufficient steps have not been taken, so far as is reasonably
practicable, to prevent unauthorised persons, in particular children, from gaining access to your 
construction site, as your site has inadequate fencing/hoarding and at least one gap large enough for 
someone to gain access to site, therefore the site is not completely fenced off. Also, the site does not have 
its full perimeter identified by suitable signs.",14/04/2022,,Ongoing,2022-05-05 16:05:03.549435+00:00
