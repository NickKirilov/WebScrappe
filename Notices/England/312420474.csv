therefore not constructed or maintained in a condition to prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, danger.

identified that your 230V ac outside sockets located on your forecourt/public rest area were not additionally protected 
by a suitably rated 30ma residual current device, where there is a risk of serious personal injury and/or death.
