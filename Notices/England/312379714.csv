Improvement Notice,"IN/SD/BC/140322-1 - 312379714
you have failed to put in place appropriate arrangements for the effective planning, organization, control, monitoring and review of the preventative and protective measures in place to prevent access to any dangerous part of machinery.

IN/SD/BC/140322-2 - 312379755
You have failed to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that you have a suitable system of training, assessment and authorisation in place to demonstrate that employees are competent in using and/or supervising the use of work equipment for the purposes of health and safety

IN/SD/BC/140322-3 - 312379776
You are using water mixed metal working fluid during high speed machining, namely in your computer numerical controlled lathes and mills, creating a mist which is hazardous to health and can cause occupational asthma. However, you have failed to control exposure to as low a level as is reasonably practicable because machines are not fitted with local exhaust ventilation, workers are exposed to mist by cleaning using compressed air guns and there is no time delay in operation prior to opening enclosure doors,so that mist can be extracted and is not present in the operatorâ€™s breathing zone.

IN/SD/BC/140322-4 - 312379795 
You have failed to ensure that employee exposure to stainless steel dust, a substance hazardous to health, has been prevented or, where this is not reasonably practicable, adequately controlled. This is because local exhaust ventilation systems have been marked as unsatisfactory, employees have not been provided with suitable respiratory protective equipment with the correct filters and workers have not been face fit tested to ensure the masks fit them sufficiently to offer adequate protection, giving rise to the risk of ill-health.",04/05/2022,,Complied with,2022-05-05 14:18:14.352270+00:00
