312410992,B A Wheels Limited,01/04/2022,Improvement Notice,"M P J C010420221: You are using a product containing dichloromethane (DCM) in the process of paint stripping alloy wheels.
You have provided local exhaust ventilation (LEV) to extract DCM vapour from the stripping tank. DCM vapour is heavier than air which means it will accumulate at low levels and should be extracted away from the breathing zone of any employees. Your LEV is incorrectly situated being above the tank as it will draw the vapour upwards into the breathing zone of your employees. It is also likely to be less effective than LEV placed to the rear or side of the tank which would capture the vapour as it is released. Your current system exposes your employees to risk of impaired consciousness and death.",04/07/2022,,Ongoing,HO/Marriott Close/B A Wheels LB A Wheels Ltd12 Marriott CloseHeigham StreetNORWICHNR2 4UXEngland,East & South East,Norwich,Total service industries,82990 - BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICE NEC,Fixed,FODOP5GP22,Field Operations Division,,East,2022-05-17 10:27:45.034280+00:00
